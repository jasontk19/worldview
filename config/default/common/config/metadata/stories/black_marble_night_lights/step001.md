The Day/Night Band allows scientists to monitor various nighttime phenomena on the Earth's surface and atmosphere in low light conditions on a daily basis. This “Black Marble Nighttime At Sensor Radiance” layer is created from the at sensor top-of-atmosphere night time Day/Night Band radiance product (VNP46A1).

- The Day/Night Band sensor is on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite and NOAA-20 satellite.
