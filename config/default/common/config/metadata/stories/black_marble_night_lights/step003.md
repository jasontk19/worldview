The layer is particularly useful for detecting city lights, lightning, auroras, fires, gas flares, and fishing fleets. Bangkok is the brightly lit metropolis in the center of the image. There are also hundreds of squid fishing vessels in the Gulf of Thailand, just south of Bangkok, as well as the Andaman Sea, to the west. The lights are used to attract plankton and fish, which draw squid to the surface to feed.
